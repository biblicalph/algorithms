# About Dynamic Programming

Problems that have an exponential time complexity (2^n, 2^n+m, etc) have no efficient algorithms that solve
them in non-exponential time.
For such problems, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming are the only ways to solve them.
An example is finding the factorial of a number. As the input grows, the time it takes to solve the problem grows exponentially.
